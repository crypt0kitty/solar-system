## Project: Create a CLI program using OO principles
Upon execution, the CLI program outputs the following:

1. **list aliens**: The CLI program, creates a separate list for Earth and Venus with the corresponding alien race(s) who live there
2. **read alien details**: If an alien race is found, details about the alien is displayed. Otherwise, a message notifies the user that the alien was not found
3. **add an alien**: A user can add their own alien. The program asks for the name of their alien. Once complete, a third list named "Guest List" is added to the program
4. **exit**: terminates the program loop to successfully exit the program
